# biographify
Inpsired by [receiptify](https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/), this website generates a biography-esque aesthetic for a Spotify user's top tracks for 1 month, 6 months, and all time. 

## Usage
After signing in with Spotify SSO, this project makes requests to Spotify API to retrieve a user's top tracks. Tracks are then formatted into a biography aesthetic and can be downloaded as png files.
